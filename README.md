For my final year project Iâ€™m creating a system to share and store files over a local network. 
It runs on a Raspberry Pi B+, powered by a battery. 
It is a small portable box which broadcasts its own WIFI network for laptops and Android devices to connect. 
The box has 4GB 

It also has a backup system in place if the box got lost, stolen or damaged that automatically backs up to a AWS S3 bucket. 
This bucket is also used to access files outside the local network.
